# Medical Image Datasets

The accuracy of a particular deep learning model is directly proportional to amount of data with which it is trained. However, acquiring medical imagesets can be particularly challenging and costly due to privacy measures and the time cost of annotating images.

Here, you can find a list medical image repositories sorted by imaging modality with which to use as in model training. Keep in mind that datasets may vary by annotation, location and pre-processing.

Make sure to thoroughly read any documentation available for each dataset.

**Important note: Many datasets must be opened with the [NBIA Data Retriever](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Downloading+TCIA+Images) with the dataset's respective TCIA or DICOM file.**
